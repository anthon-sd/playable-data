fix: implement ultra-minimal build strategy & fix directory structure

Resolves two critical Netlify deployment issues:
1. Memory issues (exit code 137) by implementing a comprehensive memory optimization strategy
2. Directory structure errors by fixing incorrect path references

Key changes:
- Removed nested directory references in netlify.toml
- Updated bootstrap script with correct paths & enhanced memory management
- Created memory monitoring tool with improved diagnostics
- Simplified Astro configuration to minimize memory usage
- Updated documentation with correct repository structure

These changes ensure successful deployment even in memory-constrained environments.
