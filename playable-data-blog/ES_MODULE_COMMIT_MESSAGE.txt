fix: convert scripts to ES modules & implement ultra-minimal build strategy

Resolves three critical Netlify deployment issues:
1. Module compatibility issues by converting all scripts from CommonJS to ES modules
2. Memory issues (exit code 137) by implementing a comprehensive memory optimization strategy
3. Directory structure errors by fixing incorrect path references

Key changes:
- Converted memory-monitor.js and netlify-bootstrap.js to ES module syntax
- Modified tailwind.config.mjs and other utility scripts for ES module compliance
- Removed nested directory references in netlify.toml
- Updated bootstrap script with correct paths & enhanced memory management
- Created memory monitoring tool with improved diagnostics
- Simplified Astro configuration to minimize memory usage
- Updated documentation with correct repository structure

These changes ensure successful deployment even in memory-constrained environments by fixing
module compatibility issues that prevented the scripts from executing properly.
