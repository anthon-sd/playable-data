refactor: simplify build process and prepare for headless CMS migration

Based on professional feedback, this commit simplifies the project
structure and build process to address fundamental architectural issues:

- Removed complex script-based build process in favor of standard Astro build
- Simplified netlify.toml with cleaner configuration and proper security headers
- Updated package.json to use standard build commands
- Simplified astro.config.mjs to remove unnecessary complexity
- Updated README.md with clearer deployment instructions 
- Added CLEANUP_RECOMMENDATIONS.md with steps to further improve the project

This is the first step toward a cleaner architecture. Next steps include:
1. Moving to a flatter directory structure
2. Migrating from Supabase to a headless CMS for content management
3. Addressing potential security issues in the codebase

These changes should result in a more maintainable codebase and more
reliable deployment process.
